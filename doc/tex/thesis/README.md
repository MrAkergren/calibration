#How to:

To compile the document, run 

```
pdflatex thesis
biber thesis
pdflatex thesis
pdflatex thesis
```

The different .tex files should include the section they are named after, and necessary settings should be added to `thesis.tex`, as it is the main file. Subsections should be added in the sectionfiles to begin with, unless they grow to large.

References should be added to `ref.bib`
